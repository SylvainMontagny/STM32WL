# STM32WL projects

## 1. STM32WL Standalone
This standalone project is a single-core project inspired by an End Node project provided by ST (see STM32Cube MCU Package for STM32WL series). A single file (General_Setup.h) is used to setup all the LoRaWAN settings (Keys, Class, Activation method, etc...) 
This project is a simple end-node program with the following application package ready:
1. Clock Synchronization
2. Multicast
3. Data Fragmentation

 **/!\ The Firmware management package is not implemented.**


## 2. STM32WL FUOTA
The FUOTA project is a single-core project. The global FUOTA project is a folder composed by different sub-projects linked together. It is a standalone folder-project extracted from the ST packages (see STM32Cube MCU Package for STM32WL series).
