# 1. LoRaWAN Application
## Presentation
This standalone project is a single-core application inspired by ST "End-Node" example (see STM32Cube MCU Package for STM32WL series). The source code has been mofified with STM32CubeIDE. A single file is used to configure the application behavior and setup all LoRaWAN settings (Root Keys or Sessions Keys). This file is : **/LoRaWAN/config_application.h**
This project shall be used with a **NUCLEO-WL55JC1 board**.

## Run the application
The only file to modify to run this project is : **/LoRaWAN/config_application.h**

1. **Open the project in you favorite IDE**

2. **Configure the LoraWAN information:**
    * The activation mode (ACTIVATION_MODE)
    * The class (CLASS)
    * The spreading factor (SPREADING_FACTOR). The default Bandwidth is 125 kHz.
    * The type of frame (CONFIRMED)
    * The application port (PORT)

3. **Configure the application payload:**
This payloads can be:
    * HELLO String (if PAYLOAD_HELLO is enable) 
    **or**
    * 1 byte simulated temperature (if PAYLOAD_TEMPERATURE is enable)
    **or**
    * all sensors payload in a Cayenne LPP format (if CAYENNE_LPP_ is enable).

4. **Choose the way you send data:**   
    * use the B3 push button (SEND_BY_PUSH_BUTTON = true)
    **or**
    * uSe a period of FRAM_DELAY ms (when SEND_BY_PUSH_BUTTON = false).

5. **Select if you want the low power modes enable( LOW_POWER = true)**

6. **Enter the LoRaWAN Keys and EUI**
    * devEUI, devAddr, nwkSKey and appSKey for an ABP end-device.
    * devEUI, appKeys and appEUI in case of OTAA end-device. 


# 2. LoRaWAN Application layer Advanced features
In addition to the previous application, this project also provide **Clock Synchronization**, **Multicast** and **Fragmentation** messaging packages activated. 

## Clock Synchronization
- Package version implemented:          1
- Dedicated LoRaWAN port:               202

## Multicast
- Package version implemented:          1
- Dedicated LoRaWAN port:               200

## Fragmentation
- Package version implemented:          1
- Dedicated LoRaWAN port:               201
- Fragmentation algorithm implemented:  FEC (Forward Error Correction)
- Available fragmentation mode:         Interop (This mode represents the minimum test proving that the end device is able to receive a data block file from the server.
                                        It doesnâ€™t allow you to perform FUOTA)
- Added modification:                   The ST package implements the version 1 of the Fragmented data block layer messaging package. That means there is no _FragDataBlockReceivedReq_ command used by the end-device to signal the fragmentation server that a data block has been completely received (command only offered by the version 2 of the package). A dedicated function has been added. When the whole data block has been rebuilt, `SendTXStopFrag()` sends 0x0001 on port 186. Payload and port are arbitrary chosen and can be adjusted. To stop sending fragments, your fragmentation server should be able to understand this message.
